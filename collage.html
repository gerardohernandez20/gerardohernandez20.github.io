<em><font color="white"><h1>I have always been a huge astronomy fanatic to a point where I watch many space documentaries and read various books about space theory. It is just what was able to grab my attention as a child. Here I present you my space project in which I have created in Clip studio and edited in Lightroom. No one truly knows how the universe looked when the big bang occurred but I like to think that it happened with various colors. I have been drawing galaxies, planets, and stars for a while now and it is the main reason why I like digital art.</h1>

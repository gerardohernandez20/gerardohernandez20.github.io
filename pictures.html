<em><font color="white"> <h2>The model you see here is my younger brother named Diego. Diego was going through a rough moment in 8th grade. Going through bullying and relationship issues I couldnâ€™t help to notice that he was not being himself. At first, I already scheduled my friend to be my model for a project I had to do for Beginning photography, but after noticing my brother the way he was I asked if he wanted to help me instead. As we walked around outside the exploratorium of San Francisco, I took photographs of him while talking about school, his relationship issues, and his emotions. Overall I think the photographs reflected the way he was feeling and just overall created a story of solitude.   </h2></font></em>

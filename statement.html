<em><font color="white"> <h2>As a child, when I first stumbled across a computer, I was surprised by the variety of things you could do, but most importantly what you can do in Microsoft paint. I know it is not the best program by any means, but for a 5-year-old who has never owned electronics other than a hunchback television back in 2004, It was like a portal into the future. All I used was Microsoft paint, I drew stars, happy faces, and cars. I will say, they weren’t very good drawings, but hey, to me it was more entertaining than going to the arcade. As I got older I was introduced to youtube, I was 10 at the time(2008), It felt like a library to me but instead of books it had videos.  I watched all kinds of videos, it didn’t matter what it was, it was like tv except I can see previews on the squares compared to cable. One night, I stumbled upon a space documentary,  I didn’t know much about what the narrator was saying, but all I know was I liked the stunning visuals they showed to represent the sun, galaxies, and meteorites. By today’s standards, they would be considered horrible renders, but for 2008, they were astonishing. From that point on I dedicated myself to learn more about the universe and to draw various forms of space-related items. It takes imagination to draw something that has never been seen before. Many of the things we have seen from space are rendered in some form, like galaxies or planets which are thousands of lightyears away. I guess that’s what pokes my curiosity so much when it comes to space. That we just don’t know the variety of colors, shades, and lighting the universe hides from us. In this case, when we draw galaxies or planets, there is no right or wrong way to draw them because there is always a possibility that they can exist in the vast universe. You can just let your imagination go wild.
	I experienced technology evolves at a fast pace, so fast that new tech devices had a short life span. Some never even made it through the year before they were considered obsolete. As this transition was recurring in my life, I noticed that art too was evolving. Movies were much cleaner and colorful, no longer did you see static or washed out colors. Video games no longer looked blocky and overstretched. Digital drawings were much glossier and loaded with havier amounts of detail. The way we will experience art will forever change as tech keeps evolving. As an artist, I want to keep experimenting with digital drawings and renders. Virtual reality is already a thing, so it is only a matter of when VR headsets will become affordable and much more widely supported. I would like to jump in and possibly make video games that are much more immersive using VR, or maybe create a galaxy render and make the user fly through the clusters of stars, dust, and gasses. Possibly fly across or inside Jupiter, the possibilities are endless. Regardless, no matter what career I do land upon, I will forever continue to draw and render what I call the colorful unseen universe.
